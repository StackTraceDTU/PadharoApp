# Padharo Mobile Application

Padharo addresses the problems faced by tourists visiting a new place such as:
- Ability to visit  places that align with his/her interests.
- Difficulty in forming an itinerary consisting of such places.
- No provision of centralised renting of tour guide.
 
## Proposed Solution

-  Fetching information such as likes, check-ins and religion, political views and using social-media analysis, the application is primarily a recommendation engine that employs reinforcement learning algorithm to suggest places of interest catering to the user.
This is combined with a provision for redeeming points assigned to each site which can be availed at partner food joints.

-   Based on the recommendations and current location of the user, the application forms an itinerary taking in account the following:
	1.    Rest time (sleep, refreshments etc.)
    
	2.  Travelling time and distance
    
	3.  Time spent at a particular site
    
	4.  Time of last visit in a day
-   Availability of tour guides and detecting the location of user, the application allows the user to rent a tour guide and rate him/her after service.

## Technology Stack 
- **UI/Front-end:** Android
- **Back-end:** Ruby on Rails
-  **Database:** SQLite3 
- **Machine learning model:** coded in Python using GraphLab and scikit
